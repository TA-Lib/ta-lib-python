# TA-Lib

[![](https://api.travis-ci.org/mrjbq7/ta-lib.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mrjbq7/ta-lib)

This is a Python wrapper for [TA-LIB](http://ta-lib.org) based on Cython
instead of SWIG. From the homepage:

> TA-Lib is widely used by trading software developers requiring to perform
> technical analysis of financial market data.

> * Includes 150+ indicators such as ADX, MACD, RSI, Stochastic, Bollinger
>   Bands, etc.
> * Candlestick pattern recognition
> * Open-source API for C/C++, Java, Perl, Python and 100% Managed .NET

The original Python bindings included with TA-Lib use
[SWIG](http://swig.org) which unfortunately are difficult to install and
aren't as efficient as they could be. Therefore this project uses Cython and
Numpy to efficiently and cleanly bind to TA-Lib -- producing results 2-4
times faster than the SWIG interface.

## Installation

You can install from PyPI:

```
$ pip install TA-Lib
```

Or checkout the sources and run ``setup.py`` yourself:

```
$ python setup.py install
```

### Troubleshooting

If you get a warning that looks like this:

```
setup.py:79: UserWarning: Cannot find ta-lib library, installation may fail.
warnings.warn('Cannot find ta-lib library, installation may fail.')
```

This typically means ``setup.py`` can't find the underlying ``TA-Lib``
library, a dependency which needs to be installed.

If you installed the underlying ``TA-Lib`` library with a custom prefix
(e.g., with ``./configure --prefix=$PREFIX``), then when you go to install
this python wrapper you can specify additional search paths to find the
library and include files for the underyling ``TA-Lib`` library using the
``TA_LIBRARY_PATH`` and ``TA_INCLUDE_PATH`` environment variables:

```sh
$ export TA_LIBRARY_PATH=$PREFIX/lib
$ export TA_INCLUDE_PATH=$PREFIX/include
$ python setup.py install # or pip install ta-lib
```

Sometimes installation will produce build errors like this:

```
func.c:256:28: fatal error: ta-lib/ta_libc.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.
```

or:

```
common.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol TA_SetUnstablePeriod
common.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol TA_Shutdown
common.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol TA_Initialize
common.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol TA_GetUnstablePeriod
common.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol TA_GetVersionString
```

This typically means that it can't find the underlying ``TA-Lib`` library, a
dependency which needs to be installed.  On Windows, this could be caused by
installing the 32-bit binary distribution of the underlying ``TA-Lib`` library,
but trying to use it with 64-bit Python.

Sometimes installation will fail with errors like this:

```
talib/common.c:8:22: fatal error: pyconfig.h: No such file or directory
 #include "pyconfig.h"
                      ^
compilation terminated.
error: command 'x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc' failed with exit status 1
```

This typically means that you need the Python headers, and should run
something like:

```
$ sudo apt-get install python3-dev
```

Sometimes building the underlying ``TA-Lib`` library has errors running
``make`` that look like this:

```
../libtool: line 1717: cd: .libs/libta_lib.lax/libta_abstract.a: No such file or directory
make[2]: *** [libta_lib.la] Error 1
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
```

This might mean that the directory path to the underlying ``TA-Lib`` library
has spaces in the directory names.  Try putting it in a path that does not have
any spaces and trying again.


### Dependencies

To use TA-Lib for python, you need to have the
[TA-Lib](http://ta-lib.org/hdr_dw.html) already installed. You should
probably follow their installation directions for your platform, but some
suggestions are included below for reference.

##### Mac OS X

```
$ brew install ta-lib
```

##### Windows

Download [ta-lib-0.4.0-msvc.zip](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/ta-lib/ta-lib-0.4.0-msvc.zip)
and unzip to ``C:\ta-lib``.

> This is a 32-bit binary release.  If you want to use 64-bit Python, you will
> need to build a 64-bit version of the library. Some unofficial (**and
> unsupported**) instructions for building on 64-bit Windows 10, here for
> reference:
>
> 1. Download and Unzip ``ta-lib-0.4.0-msvc.zip``
> 2. Move the Unzipped Folder ``ta-lib`` to ``C:\``
> 3. Download and Install Visual Studio Community 2015
>    * Remember to Select ``[Visual C++]`` Feature
> 4. Build TA-Lib Library
>    * From Windows Start Menu, Start ``[VS2015 x64 Native Tools Command
>      Prompt]``
>    * Move to ``C:\ta-lib\c\make\cdr\win32\msvc``
>    * Build the Library ``nmake``

You might also try these unofficial windows binaries for both 32-bit and
64-bit:

https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#ta-lib

##### Linux

Download [ta-lib-0.4.0-src.tar.gz](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/ta-lib/ta-lib-0.4.0-src.tar.gz) and:

```
$ tar -xzf ta-lib-0.4.0-src.tar.gz
$ cd ta-lib/
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

> If you build ``TA-Lib`` using ``make -jX`` it will fail but that's OK!
> Simply rerun ``make -jX`` followed by ``[sudo] make install``.

## Function API

Similar to TA-Lib, the Function API provides a lightweight wrapper of the
exposed TA-Lib indicators.

Each function returns an output array and have default values for their
parameters, unless specified as keyword arguments. Typically, these functions
will have an initial "lookback" period (a required number of observations
before an output is generated) set to ``NaN``.

For convenience, the Function API supports both ``numpy.ndarray`` and
``pandas.Series`` inputs.

All of the following examples use the Function API:

```python
import numpy
import talib

close = numpy.random.random(100)
```

Calculate a simple moving average of the close prices:

```python
output = talib.SMA(close)
```

Calculating bollinger bands, with triple exponential moving average:

```python
from talib import MA_Type

upper, middle, lower = talib.BBANDS(close, matype=MA_Type.T3)
```

Calculating momentum of the close prices, with a time period of 5:

```python
output = talib.MOM(close, timeperiod=5)
```

## Abstract API

If you're already familiar with using the function API, you should feel right
at home using the Abstract API.

Every function takes a collection of named inputs, either a ``dict`` of
``numpy.ndarray`` or ``pandas.Series``, or a ``pandas.DataFrame``. If a
``pandas.DataFrame`` is provided, the output is returned as a
``pandas.DataFrame`` with named output columns.

For example, inputs could be provided for the typical "OHLCV" data:

```python
import numpy as np

# note that all ndarrays must be the same length!
inputs = {
    'open': np.random.random(100),
    'high': np.random.random(100),
    'low': np.random.random(100),
    'close': np.random.random(100),
    'volume': np.random.random(100)
}
```

Functions can either be imported directly or instantiated by name:

```python
from talib import abstract

# directly
SMA = abstract.SMA

# or by name
SMA = abstract.Function('sma')
```

From there, calling functions is basically the same as the function API:

```python
from talib.abstract import *

# uses close prices (default)
output = SMA(inputs, timeperiod=25)

# uses open prices
output = SMA(inputs, timeperiod=25, price='open')

# uses close prices (default)
upper, middle, lower = BBANDS(inputs, 20, 2, 2)

# uses high, low, close (default)
slowk, slowd = STOCH(inputs, 5, 3, 0, 3, 0) # uses high, low, close by default

# uses high, low, open instead
slowk, slowd = STOCH(inputs, 5, 3, 0, 3, 0, prices=['high', 'low', 'open'])
```

## Supported Indicators and Functions

We can show all the TA functions supported by TA-Lib, either as a ``list`` or
as a ``dict`` sorted by group (e.g. "Overlap Studies", "Momentum Indicators",
etc):

```python
import talib

# list of functions
print talib.get_functions()

# dict of functions by group
print talib.get_function_groups()
```
