# TA-Lib

From [TA-LIB's](http://ta-lib.org) homepage:

> TA-Lib is widely used by trading software developers requiring to perform
> technical analysis of financial market data.

> * Includes 200 indicators such as ADX, MACD, RSI, Stochastic, Bollinger
>   Bands, etc.
> * Candlestick pattern recognition
> * Open-source API for C/C++, Java, Perl, Python and 100% Managed .NET

Unfortunately, the included Python bindings use [SWIG](http://swig.org),
are a little difficult to install (particularly on Mac OS X), and aren't as
efficient as they could be. This project uses Cython and Numpy to efficiently
and cleanly bind to TA-Lib -- producing results 2-4 times faster than the SWIG
interface.

## Installation

You can install from PyPI:

```
$ easy_install TA-Lib
```

Or checkout the sources and run ``setup.py`` yourself:

```
$ python setup.py install
```

Note: this requires that you have already installed the ``TA-Lib`` library
on your computer (you can [download it](http://ta-lib.org/hdr_dw.html) or
use your computers package manager to install it, e.g.,
``brew install ta-lib`` on Mac OS X).

## Troubleshooting

If you get build errors like this, it typically means that it can't find the
underlying ``TA-Lib`` library and needs to be installed:

```
func.c:256:28: fatal error: ta-lib/ta_libc.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.
```

If you get build errors compiling the underlying ``TA-Lib`` such as these:
```
mv -f .deps/gen_code-gen_code.Tpo .deps/gen_code-gen_code.Po
mv: cannot stat `.deps/gen_code-gen_code.Tpo': No such file or directory
make[3]: *** [gen_code-gen_code.o] Error 1/bin/bash ../../../libtool --tag=CC --mode=link gcc -g -O2 -L../../ta_common -L../../ta_abstract -L../../ta_func -o gen_code gen_code-gen_code.o -lta_common -lta_abstract_gc -lta_func -lm -lpthread -ldl
```
Simply rerunning ``make`` and then ``sudo make install`` seems to always do the trick.

## Function API Examples

Similar to TA-Lib, the function interface provides a lightweight wrapper of
the exposed TA-Lib indicators.

Each function returns an output array and have default values for their
parameters, unless specified as keyword arguments. Typically, these functions
will have an initial "lookback" period (a required number of observations
before an output is generated) set to ``NaN``.

All of the following examples use the function API:

```python
import numpy
import talib

close = numpy.random.random(100)
```

Calculate a simple moving average of the close prices:

```python
output = talib.SMA(close)
```

Calculating bollinger bands, with triple exponential moving average:

```python
from talib import MA_Type

upper, middle, lower = talib.BBANDS(close, matype=MA_Type.T3)
```

Calculating momentum of the close prices, with a time period of 5:

```python
output = talib.MOM(close, timeperiod=5)
```

## Abstract API Examples

TA-Lib also provides an abstract interface for calling functions. Our
wrapper for the abstract interface is somewhat different from the upstream
implementation. The abstract interface is designed to make the TA-Lib easily
introspectable and dynamically programmable. Of course Python allows for
these things too, but this helps do some of the heavy lifting for you, making
it much easier to for example add a TA-Lib indicator control panel to a
GUI charting program. It also unifies the interface for using and calling
functions making life easier on the developer.

If you're already familiar with using the function API, you should feel right
at home using the abstract API. Every function takes the same input, passed
as a dictionary of observed values:

```python
import numpy as np
# note that all ndarrays must be the same length!
inputs = {
    'open': np.random.random(100),
    'high': np.random.random(100),
    'low': np.random.random(100),
    'close': np.random.random(100),
    'volume': np.random.random(100)
}
```

From this input data, let's again calculate a simple moving average (SMA),
this time with the abstract interface:

```python
from talib.abstract import Function
output = Function('sma', input_arrays).outputs

# teaser:
output = Function('sma')(input_arrays, timeperiod=20, price='close')
upper, middle, lower = Function('bbands')(input_arrays, 20, 2, 2)
print Function('STOCH').info
```

You'll notice a few things are different. The function is now a class,
initialized with any supported function name (case insensitive) and optionally
``input_arrays``. To run the TA function with our input data, we access the
``outputs`` property. It wraps a method that ensures the results are always
valid so long as the ``input_arrays`` dict was already set. Speaking of which,
the SMA function only takes one input, and we gave it five!

Certain TA functions define which price series names they expect for input.
Others, like SMA, don't (we'll explain how to figure out which in a moment).
``Function`` will use the closing prices by default on TA functions that take
one undefined input, or the high and the low prices for functions taking two.
We can override the default like so:

```python
sma = Function('sma', input_arrays)
sma.set_function_args(timeperiod=10, price='open')
output = sma.outputs
```

This works by using keyword arguments. For functions with one undefined input,
the keyword is ``price``; for two they are ``price0`` and ``price1``. That's a
lot of typing; let's introduce some shortcuts:

```python
output = Function('sma').run(input_arrays)
output = Function('sma')(input_arrays, price='open')
```

The ``run()`` method is a shortcut to ``outputs`` that also optionally accepts
an ``input_arrays`` dict to use for calculating the function values. You can
also call the ``Function`` instance directly; this shortcut to ``outputs``
allows setting both ``input_arrays`` and/or any function parameters and
keywords. These methods make up all the ways you can call the TA function and
get its values.

``Function.outputs`` returns either a single ndarray or a list of ndarrays,
depending on how many outputs the TA function has. This information can be
found through ``Function.output_names`` or ``Function.info['outputs']``.

``Function.info`` is a very useful property. It returns a dict with almost
every detail of the current state of the ``Function`` instance:

```python
print Function('stoch').info
{
  'name': 'STOCH',
  'display_name': 'Stochastic',
  'group': 'Momentum Indicators',
  'input_names': OrderedDict([
    ('prices', ['high', 'low', 'close']),
  ]),
  'parameters': OrderedDict([
    ('fastk_period', 5),
    ('slowk_period', 3),
    ('slowk_matype', 0),
    ('slowd_period', 3),
    ('slowd_matype', 0),
  ]),
  'output_names': ['slowk', 'slowd'],
  'flags': None,
}
```

Take a look at the value of the ``input_names`` key. There's only one input
price variable, 'prices', and its value is a list of price series names.
This is one of those TA functions where TA-Lib defines which price series it
expects for input. Any time ``input_names`` is an OrderedDict with one key,
``prices``, and a list for a value, it means TA-Lib defined the expected price
series names. You can override these just the same as undefined inputs, just
make sure to use a list with the correct number of price series names! (it
varies across functions)

You can also use ``Function.input_names`` to get/set the price series names,
and ``Function.parameters`` to get/set the function parameters. Let's expand
on the other ways to set TA function arguments:

```python
from talib import MA_Type

output = Function('sma')(input_arrays, timeperiod=10, price='high')

upper, middle, lower = Function('bbands')(input_arrays, timeperiod=20, matype=MA_Type.EMA)

stoch = Function('stoch', input_arrays)
stoch.set_function_args(slowd_period=5)
slowk, slowd = stoch(15, fastd_period=5) # 15 == fastk_period specified positionally
```

``input_arrays`` must be passed as a positional argument (or left out
entirely). TA function parameters can be passed as positional or keyword
arguments. Input price series names must be passed as keyword arguments (or
left out entirely). In fact, the ``__call__`` method of ``Function`` simply
calls ``set_function_args()``.

For your convenience, we create ``Function`` wrappers for all of the available
TA-Lib functions:

```python
from talib.abstract import SMA, BBANDS, STOCH

output = SMA(input_arrays)

upper, middle, lower = BBANDS(input_arrays, timeperiod=20)

slowk, slowd = STOCH(input_arrays, fastk_period=15, fastd_period=5)
```

## Indicators

We can show all the TA functions supported by TA-Lib, either as a ``list`` or
as a ``dict`` sorted by group (e.g. "Overlap Studies", "Momentum Indicators",
etc):

```python
import talib

print talib.get_functions()
print talib.get_function_groups()
```
