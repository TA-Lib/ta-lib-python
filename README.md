# TA-Lib

This is a Python wrapper for [TA-LIB](http://ta-lib.org) based on Cython
instead of SWIG. From the homepage:

> TA-Lib is widely used by trading software developers requiring to perform
> technical analysis of financial market data.

> * Includes 150+ indicators such as ADX, MACD, RSI, Stochastic, Bollinger
>   Bands, etc.
> * Candlestick pattern recognition
> * Open-source API for C/C++, Java, Perl, Python and 100% Managed .NET

The original Python bindings use [SWIG](http://swig.org) which unfortunately
are difficult to install and aren't as efficient as they could be. Therefore
this project uses Cython and Numpy to efficiently and cleanly bind to TA-Lib
-- producing results 2-4 times faster than the SWIG interface.

## Installation

You can install from PyPI:

```
$ easy_install TA-Lib
```

Or checkout the sources and run ``setup.py`` yourself:

```
$ python setup.py install
```

### Troubleshooting

Sometimes installation will produce build errors like this:

```
func.c:256:28: fatal error: ta-lib/ta_libc.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.
```

This typically means that it can't find the underlying ``TA-Lib`` library,
a dependency which needs to be installed.

### Dependencies

To use TA-Lib for python, you need to have the
[TA-Lib](http://ta-lib.org/hdr_dw.html) already installed:

##### Mac OS X

```
$ brew install ta-lib
```

##### Windows

Download [ta-lib-0.4.0-msvc.zip](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/ta-lib/ta-lib-0.4.0-msvc.zip)
and unzip to ``C:\ta-lib``

##### Linux

Download [ta-lib-0.4.0-src.tar.gz](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/ta-lib/ta-lib-0.4.0-src.tar.gz) and:
```
$ untar and cd
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

> If you build ``TA-Lib`` using ``make -jX`` it will fail but that's OK!
> Simply rerun ``make -jX`` followed by ``[sudo] make install``.

## Function API

Similar to TA-Lib, the Function API provides a lightweight wrapper of the
exposed TA-Lib indicators.

Each function returns an output array and have default values for their
parameters, unless specified as keyword arguments. Typically, these functions
will have an initial "lookback" period (a required number of observations
before an output is generated) set to ``NaN``.

For convenience, the Function API supports both ``numpy.ndarray`` and
``pandas.Series`` types.

All of the following examples use the Function API:

```python
import numpy
import talib

close = numpy.random.random(100)
```

Calculate a simple moving average of the close prices:

```python
output = talib.SMA(close)
```

Calculating bollinger bands, with triple exponential moving average:

```python
from talib import MA_Type

upper, middle, lower = talib.BBANDS(close, matype=MA_Type.T3)
```

Calculating momentum of the close prices, with a time period of 5:

```python
output = talib.MOM(close, timeperiod=5)
```

## Abstract API

If you're already familiar with using the function API, you should feel right
at home using the Abstract API.

Every function takes a collection of named inputs, either a ``dict`` of
``numpy.ndarray`` or ``pandas.Series``, or a ``pandas.DataFrame``. If a
``pandas.DataFrame`` is provided, the output is returned as a
``pandas.DataFrame`` with named output columns.

For example, inputs could be provided for the typical "OHLCV" data:

```python
import numpy as np

# note that all ndarrays must be the same length!
inputs = {
    'open': np.random.random(100),
    'high': np.random.random(100),
    'low': np.random.random(100),
    'close': np.random.random(100),
    'volume': np.random.random(100)
}
```

Functions can either be imported directly or instantiated by name:

```python
from talib import abstract

# directly
sma = abstract.SMA

# or by name
sma = abstract.Function('sma')
```

From there, calling functions is basically the same as the function API:

```python
from talib.abstract import *

# uses close prices (default)
output = SMA(inputs, timeperiod=25)

# uses open prices
output = SMA(inputs, timeperiod=25, price='open')

# uses close prices (default)
upper, middle, lower = BBANDS(inputs, 20, 2, 2)

# uses high, low, close (default)
slowk, slowd = STOCH(inputs, 5, 3, 0, 3, 0) # uses high, low, close by default

# uses high, low, open instead
slowk, slowd = STOCH(inputs, 5, 3, 0, 3, 0, prices=['high', 'low', 'open'])
```

## Supported Indicators and Functions

We can show all the TA functions supported by TA-Lib, either as a ``list`` or
as a ``dict`` sorted by group (e.g. "Overlap Studies", "Momentum Indicators",
etc):

```python
import talib

# list of functions
print talib.get_functions()

# dict of functions by group
print talib.get_function_groups()
```

If Pandas is installed, you can get all the TA functions supported by TA-Lib as a ``DataFrame``:

```python
# DataFrame of functions
print talib.get_functions_df()

# DataFrame of functions by group
print talib.get_functions_grouped_df()
```
