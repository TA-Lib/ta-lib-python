To get started developing on talib, clone the latest code from git and install:

$ git clone git://github.com/mrjbq7/ta-lib.git
$ cd ta-lib
# you can run "git pull" here (no quotes) to update the sources in the future
$ make build
$ [sudo] make install

Here's the full list of make commands (see the Makefile file):
make build     # builds and places libs in the project directory; required for testing
make clean     # cleans the local build files
make install   # installs talib system-wide
make generate: # generates a fresh func.pyx file. Requires talib and TA-Lib to both be installed
make perf      # run performance profiling
make test      # run tests

The source code is comprised of one python package, located in the talib directory,
which itself has three Cython modules: func, abstract, and common.

talib/common.pyx
  An internal-use module for functionality shared between func and abstract.

talib/func.pyx
  This file is generated automatically by tools/generate.py and any changes made
  to it directly will get overwritten!

talib/abstract.pyx
  This file contains the code for interfacing with the TA-Lib abstract interface
  and wrapping it into a pythonic Function class.

talib/libc.pxd
  This "Cython header file" defines the C-level functions, variables and types we
  need to use in the above pyx files.

tools/generate.py
  A script that generates and prints func.pyx to stdout. Gets information
  about all functions from the C headers of the installed TA-Lib.

If you are interested in developing new indicator functions or whatnot on the
underlying TA-Lib, you must install TA-Lib from svn. Here's how (Linux tested):
```
$ cd ~/dev
$ svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/ta-lib/code/trunk@1545 ta-lib-code
# later revisions break building ta_regtest (but claim to add support for VS2012)
$ cd ta-lib-code/ta-lib/c/make/gen_make
$ perl ./gen_make.pl
$ # cd ta-lib-code/ta-lib/c/make/cmr && make --> compile the code (no install)
$ cd ~/dev/ta-lib-code/tools
# Depending upon your platform you may need to make minor changes to this script:
$ perl ./release_unix.pl -version 0.4.X -source ../ta-lib/c
$ cd ~/ta-lib-0.4.X-work/dist
# the installable source package will be here, and if you wanted, the deb/rpm
# packages then see http://ta-lib.org/d_misc/how-to_function.html and the
# README/comments in the src
```
