- [NEW]: Upgrade to Cython 0.18.

- [FIX]: Improve docstrings for indicators in talib.func.

- [FIX]: Initialize and shutdown underlying TA-Lib only once each process.
  This should give slight speedups when using many indicators (<5%).

- [DEPRECATED]: The old moving average types that were in talib.func are now
  deprecated. See the next bullet item for the replacement, or you can
  continue using them with "from talib import deprecated" for the time being.

- [NEW]: The new moving average types are in talib.MA_Type. It's a class with SMA,
  EMA, DEMA, etc attribute variables you should now use. Human-readable lookups
  are also possible by using MA_Type as a dict e.g.:

    MA_Type[MA_Type.SMA] # returns "Simple Moving Average"

- [NEW]: In addition to the existing func interface, we now provide an
  enhanced abstract interface too. Functions in "import talib" use the
  original interface, or you can use "from talib import abstract" for
  the full abstract interface. See the README, tools/example.py and
  tests/abstract_test.py for more information. The full (commented)
  source code is mostly located in talib/abstract.pyx. The basic usage is very
  similar:

    input_arrays = { 'open': np.random.random(100),
                     'high': np.random.random(100),
                     'low': np.random.random(100),
                     'close': np.random.random(100),
                     'volume': np.random.random(100) }
    ema_20 = abstract.Function('ema', input_arrays, 20).outputs # function names not case-sensitive
    slowd, slowk = abstract.Function('STOCH')(input_arrays, 15, 3, 0, 3, 0)
    upper, middle, lower = abstract.Function('bbands')(input_arrays, timeperiod=20)

0.4.2

  in a future release.
