-------------- Version 0.X.X [9/99/9999] ------------------
[CHANGE]: The talib module got renamed to func and moved into the talib package.
    Use "from talib import func" now.

[DEPRECATED]: The old moving average types in func are now deprecated. See the
    next bullet for the replacement, or you could use "from talib import deprecated"
    for the deprecated types.

[NEW]: The new moving average types are in talib.MA_Type. It's a class, with
    SMA, EMA, DEMA, etc attribute variables you should now use. Human-readable
    Lookups are also possible by using MA_Type as a dict eg:
        MA_Type[MA_Type.SMA] # returns "Simple Moving Average"

[NEW]: In addition to the existing func interface, we now provide an enhanced
    abstract interface too. Functions in "import talib" use this interface, or
    you can use "from talib import abstract" for the full abstract interface.
    See the README, examples/example.py and talib/tests/abstract_test.py for
    more information. The full (commented) source code is mostly located in
    talib/abstract.pyx. The basic usage is very similar:

    input_arrays = { 'open': np.random.random(100),
                     'high': np.random.random(100),
                     'low': np.random.random(100),
                     'close': np.random.random(100),
                     'volume': np.random.random(100) }
    ema_20 = abstract.Function('ema', input_arrays, 20).outputs # function names not case-sensitive
    slowd, slowk = abstract.Function('STOCH')(input_arrays, 15, 3, 0, 3, 0)
    upper, middle, lower = abstract.Function('bbands')(input_arrays, timeperiod=20)
