How to regenerate the Makefiles?
================================
All makefiles are re-generated by doing:

c:\> perl ./gen_make.pl

If you did add a TA function, you must first compile
and run gen_code. This will generate:
    "ta-lib\ta_func_list.txt"

This .txt file is used as an input to re-generate many
makefiles when gen_make.pl is executed.

==============
What is tmake?
==============
The makefiles are generated by tmake. This utility
is not included in this package. This is freely
available from Trolltech (the maker of the QT
library). Just put the tmake in your path and
you are done (TA-lib comes with all the required
template).

TMake version tested: V1.7 and V1.8

A bug in V1.9 and 1.10 prevents tmake to work.
For now, use an older tmake version.

================================
Porting to new Compiler/platform
================================
If you can't find your platform-compiler
in the ta-lib/c/make/template, you may consider
to copy additional templates from the TMAKE
distribution. 

The gen_make.pl will create all the needed
directories and generates Makefiles for all
templates find in ta-lib/c/make/template.
